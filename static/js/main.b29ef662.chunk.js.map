Here's why you should consider remote work.</h1>\r\n            <p>About a year and a half ago when I started working remotely at Melewi I was super excited about having the freedom to decide where to work from and how to organize my productive hours. Up to that point, I’d heard and read a lot about the remote lifestyle, digital nomadism and the romanticized vision of traveling and working independently. I was definitely eager to try it out myself. I had no idea at the time that just 16 months later, I’d be a dad and working remotely would pose far greater benefits.</p>\r\n            <p>The first couple of weeks after having a baby are probably the hardest (although many people will argue it’s actually 12 years later). You’re still not sure what’s happening and you feel like every false move you make will mess up your kid for life. I’m really glad I got to share this moment with my partner, so we can stress out together and laugh about it later on.</p>\r\n            <p>When you’re expecting a kid, it’s easy to fall into the Google trap, researching all the things that can go wrong. One of them is Postpartum Depression. It’s a form of depression women often develop right after birth, because of the sudden drop of hormone levels. The reasons for its onset are chemical and psychological, but also social, so among the recommendations for avoiding and coping with PPD is to nurture the relationship with your partner.</p>\r\n            <p>As you might’ve guessed, this is where working from home comes in quite handy.</p>\r\n            <p>Sure, sometimes companies allow the father/second parent 2 weeks of time off (in addition to the mother’s parental leave) to help out with whatever he or she can in those tough first weeks. Beyond that, the mother is left to care for the child, while the other parent has to go back to work. Working remotely gives you the freedom not to separate those two.</p>\r\n            <p>Without a doubt, working from home is a huge plus when it comes to getting used to this new life of being a parent. I can take a break from work to have lunch together with my girlfriend or help out with house chores. Even if I’m just sitting in the next room, having a call with someone on the other side of the planet, it helps her know that she’s not alone in this and it helps me get used to being a dad, without having to keep a photo of my kid on my office desk.</p>\r\n            <p>It also allows me to help out with whatever I can — at this early stage, the baby largely depends on the mother for food, which makes me feel a bit helpless. What I can do instead is to try and make her life easier, so she can focus on breastfeeding and regaining strength.</p>\r\n            <p>Working from home gives me a chance to spend more time with my kid — something I feel both of us will appreciate in the future too. Previously, remote working was something accessible only to a specific group of people — mainly solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and software developers. I’m glad that changed. With advancing technologies, almost every task can be done remotely, so you don’t really have to get separated from your family to do work.</p>\r\n            <p>Having a kid is no joke. It takes its toll both on the body and the mind and nobody should have to go through it alone. Working remotely doesn’t only mean typing away on your laptop from tropical beaches or cozy cafes. It also means providing your new family with the moral and physical support they need.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='data'><Link to='/blog'>←Back</Link></h2>\r\n        </animated.div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexport default RemoteWorkFamily;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring';\r\nimport '../blog.css';\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst BetterProposals = () => {\r\n    const fade = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}, delay: 400})\r\n    return (        \r\n        <animated.div style={fade} className='about post'>\r\n            <h1 className='header'>How to write better proposals and close more deals</h1>\r\n            <p>Let me paint this hypothetical picture for you — you’ve just finished an initial sales call or live meeting with a prospective client. The meeting went really well. First you told them a little bit about your company and how you work, then they told you a little bit about their company and what they need. You asked some good questions, they gave you some valuable information. You both agreed on next steps — you’ll discuss with your team and get back to them with a time & cost estimate.</p>\r\n            <p>Some days later you’re ready with the proposal. You feel confident about the piece of document you’ve assembled. It covers all the points mentioned during the meeting and lays out a clear plan of action. You’ve added some buffer time — just in case — and the total cost makes sense, considering the scope of work. You attach it to a friendly email and hit “Send”.</p>\r\n            <p>A few days pass by. No reply.</p>\r\n            <p>You follow up with an email. “Just wanted to make sure…”, “Let me know if there’s anything…”, “Feel free to…”.</p>\r\n            <p>A week goes by. Still no reply. Maybe you received a short “Need more time to discuss internally”, but things are definitely not moving forward.</p>\r\n            <p>Why didn’t it work out? Well, there can be a number of reasons, but one of them is certain — you didn’t present your proposal in person.</p>\r\n            <p>When you send a PDF proposal per email, there’s a few things that immediately happen. Depending on the time of day you send it and how busy the receiving person is, they may glance at the email and leave a mental note to take a look at the proposal later. At which point they get into a whirlwind of distractions and forget about it. Until your next follow up, when things repeat.</p>\r\n            <p>If they do open the document, that funky layout you prepared, those bullet points and convincing arguments will have little to no effect. The lead will immediately scroll down to the estimated project price, at which point, depending on their budget, they’ll either go back to check the rest of the proposal or exit the PDF and go about their day.</p>\r\n            <p>Sometimes, they may be free enough (it’s really not a matter of courtesy) to let you know that you’re outside their budget, but most of the time this effort has no added value to them. You following up endlessly will increase their value in replying, by making you stop filling their inbox, but the end result is the same — your proposal won’t be accepted.</p>\r\n            <p>Now, consider getting on a call (ideally with video) or setting up a personal meeting and presenting your proposal to the lead.</p>\r\n            <p>This gives you control of the conversation and makes you determine what information your lead will see at which point in time. You can start with some chit-chat, transition to your action plan, go through all the points from your proposal, justify the time needed and emphasise the value you’ll bring to your client and the benefits they’ll get from paying the price you estimated.</p>\r\n            <p>Ideally, by the time you get to your price estimate, they’ll have the full picture of how you came to that price and they’ll understand what they’ll be getting in exchange for that fee.</p>\r\n            <p>If the price is still too far outside their budget, there’s only little more you can do. But this way you’ll certainly have a much higher chance of persuading them to pay this price by creating a conversation, instead of a one-sided interaction with your document. Having this conversation allows you to witness the immediate reaction of your lead and gives you an opportunity to counteract any negative feelings they may be having on the spot.</p>\r\n            <p>This is a crucial moment, because you can steer the conversation in the direction you want — ask them questions and understand their objections. Often times, when they reply to your emailed proposal with rejection, you won’t get an explanation. They’ll only say they’ve chosen to go with another partner, but unless you specifically ask for feedback, they’ll rarely mention this themselves — and by the time they do, it’ll be too late.</p>\r\n            <p>So, increase your chances of getting a “yes” to your proposal by creating a conversation with your lead and maintaining an interaction. Of course, a lot also depends on the quality of your presentation, but that’s a topic for another time.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='data'><Link to='/blog'>←Back</Link></h2>\r\n        </animated.div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexport default BetterProposals;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring';\r\nimport '../blog.css';\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport quora3 from '../../../img/quora3.png';\r\nimport quora2 from '../../../img/quora2.png';\r\nimport quora1 from '../../../img/quora1.png';\r\n\r\nconst FamousOnQuora = () => {\r\n    const fade = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}, delay: 400})\r\n    return (        \r\n        <animated.div style={fade} className='about post'>\r\n            <h1 className='header'>How to become famous on Quora</h1>\r\n            <p>Quora is one of the lesser used social media platforms when it comes to marketing a company or product.

This feature of following people’s profiles is one of the things that make Quora an excellent place to market your idea or product.</p>\r\n            <p>You see, when you give an answer on any question on Quora, besides your name you also have this one-liner, which tells a little bit about you and why you should be considered an authority on answering said question. Placing your company’s name in that one liner makes it possible for thousands, in some cases even hundreds of thousands of people to see your answer and your company’s name.</p>\r\n            <h3>So what makes a good answer?</h3>\r\n            <p>A good answer to a question usually means its extensive and provides all the necessary information to help the asking person make a better decision. In the context of Quora, there’s more to it than that. There’s a huge amount of people, who can give more or less the same piece of information, so you have to do more than just list facts.</p>\r\n            <p>There’s a couple of easy tricks you can do that will make your replies really stand out. For starters, always aim to include humour and personal stories when writing an answer. The readers will find it much easier to digest the information if they can relate to an everyday human story. A good example of this is Dushka Zapata, who always turns a seemingly trivial encounter into a story with a relevant outcome to the asked question. If you start following successful writers on Quora you’ll notice that probably all of them will add an image to the answers they post. It shouldn’t be a surprise that people respond better to an image than to a wall of text. It’s a relatively easy thing to do, but will make a huge difference. Make sure that the image is free to use (you can use sites like Unsplash to find something relevant).</p>\r\n            <p>Format your answer for better readability. This one is pretty important. Compose your answer to deliver the information as effortlessly for the reader as possible. This means having clear paragraphs for important points and separate topics. The paragraphs shouldn’t be too long (1 to 3 sentences max) so that it’s easier on the eye when reading on mobile.</p>\r\n            <p>Bold crucial statements and put questions & quotes in italic. Avoid unnecessary words like “very”, “really” or “definitely”. Also, use bullet points whenever you need to list more than 2 things. Again, those are a few easy things to do that will make a heavy impact on your views.</p>\r\n            <p>It’s also a good idea to give your answer a positive ending. Imagine your answer like a short story. Like every good story it should have an intro, a problem and a resolution. Ending on a positive note will inspire your readers and leave them with a warm feeling. Probably the most important thing to remember (and something I’ve seen so many people get wrong) is never to directly promote whatever you want to promote. Even if everyone knows people provide answers in order to get noticed and plug their business, whenever you post a direct link to your service, your reputation will inevitably go down. It’s way too sales-y and not at all what the Quora community is about — sharing knowledge.</p>\r\n            <h3>The biggest success</h3>\r\n            <p>The highest form of recognition on Quora is to be published in one of their partner media outlets, e.g. Time, Inc Magazine, The Huffington Post. Of course, the first thing to do in order to get published is to write an exceptional answer. You can, however, increase your odds by following a few simple steps. You can carefully research what topics are frequently being published by the Quora media team and aim to reply to questions in exactly those topics.</p>\r\n            <p>“How do I find those topics?”, I hear you asking.</p>\r\n            <p>Find a Quora user with the title “Quora Media and Publishing Team”. Go to their profile and look through the topics and people they follow. This will give you an idea of where they’re most likely to look for quality content to submit for publishing.</p>\r\n            <p>After that it’s all about writing an excellent answer in one of those topics and remembering to follow the guidelines I mentioned above. Focus on questions that warrant an answer with actionable steps and advice that can actually be implemented by the reader.</p>\r\n            <p>There will surely be a huge amount of questions, so naturally, it’ll be impossible to submit quality answers to each one of them. Instead, aim for those that have the most followers. This means they’ll be seen by more people and the chance of them getting picked up by the publishing team will be higher.</p>\r\n            <h3>The ultimate goal</h3>\r\n            <p>You started the long journey of becoming a Quora writer so you can get noticed and showcase your work to the world. That’s exactly what you need to do with your profile. When you become good at writing on Quora, people will visit your profile and follow you. You need to make sure that, same as the posts you write, you provide relevant information in an easy-to-read manner.</p>\r\n            <p>This is the place to expand on your Quora one-liner people see every time you post an answer. Start with the essence of what you do summarised in one sentence.</p>\r\n            <p>Then, provide links to your other projects or whatever you want to lead people to. If you have some memorable Quora submission you can boast with, it’s an excellent idea to put links of them as well. This will bring even more views to those quality answers in an organic way.</p>\r\n            <img className='postImg' src={quora3} alt='Nelson Wang on Quora' />\r\n            <p>Quora is about providing knowledge and perspective as much as it’s about being human and sharing your personal experience others can relate to. In a world of fake profiles and pretend images what truly stands out is a sincere approach to bringing value to others.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='data'><Link to='/blog'>←Back</Link></h2>\r\n        </animated.div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexport default FamousOnQuora;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring';\r\nimport '../blog.css';\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst RemoteMonth = () => {\r\n    const fade = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}, delay: 400})\r\n    return (        \r\n        <animated.div style={fade} className='about post'>\r\n            <h1 className='header'>How to become famous on Quora</h1>\r\n            <p>People have been writing about it left and right for years. Articles, blog posts even books. Just like any other fad, every aspect of working remotely has been covered extensively. You’ve most likely heard both the good and the bad sides of location independent work. If not from those articles, at least from that someone you know, who’s doing something that has to do with social media, but from home. Well, it just so happened that I recently ventured into the world of remote work. This is what I think after a month doing it.</p>\r\n            <h3>It’s not all beachers and hipster cafes</h3>\r\n            <p>So initially I was supposed to go to Berlin and start a job at this company based in the city. As it turns out, often times things like to go on their own way. I was contacted by another company and eventually started working for them — remotely. In fact, it’s not just me — every team member at Melewi works independently from a location of their choosing.</p>\r\n            <p>At first, I went to work from various cafes, seriously increasing my caffeine intake and comfortably mixing in with the crowd of MacBook users. Berlin is perfect for that, since it has an abundance of cafes attracting freelancers and remote workers (and people with MacBooks).</p>\r\n            <p>For a while it feels good to have this excitement of working from an unfamiliar place every day. Then after about two week, every cafe looked and felt pretty much similar to the previous one. Not long after that, it seemed like more of a hassle to think about where I should work from today, plan my route, think about where I should eat and all those little things that you don’t normally consider straight away.</p>\r\n            <p>The workload was also smaller in the beginning. But as the onboarding process went on I gradually got more and more responsibility and suddenly I had a number of tasks that I needed to finish before a deadline. Then I started noticing that all this time running around from point A to point B to point C back to point B actually accumulates and becomes a significant part of my day.</p>\r\n            <p>It’s good to diversify from time to time by working from a cafe, but doing it every day turns into a mundane routine by itself, which sort of defeats the purpose of location independent work.</p>\r\n            <p>To be honest, I have colleagues that like to work from their favourite cafes and that works for them. Maybe after doing it for a while it turns into a process and you increase your efficiency, which compensates the commute to different venues. It didn’t work for me at this stage.</p>\r\n            <h3>It’s work as usual</h3>\r\n            <p>From what I’ve seen so far I feel like the general perception of remote work is that it’s way more relaxed than working from an office. This is only partly true.</p>\r\n            <p>For those that think working from home is more relaxed because of the fewer external distractions — it’s absolutely right. There’s no team members interrupting you for a second to get your opinion on this and this. Or getting into a 20 minutes meeting that turns into a 1 hour discussion.</p>\r\n            <p>But for those who think it’s more relaxed because you’ll be able to slack off and have more time, this is completely wrong. Working remotely usually requires a lot more of you justifying what you do. Sure, you can distribute your working hours at your convenience, but that doesn’t mean those hours will be less than with a traditional job.</p>\r\n            <p>In fact, as <a className='data' href='https://medium.com/@jasonfried'>Jason Fried</a> often points out, one of the risks of remote work is overworking. A lot of people have trouble setting straight boundaries between working hours and free time.</p>\r\n            <p>It’s natural, if you think about it. You have tasks that you want to follow up with or you suddenly think of something you have to discuss with one of your colleagues, who happens to be online. Too bad it’s 12am.</p>\r\n            <p>You need to be conscience about doing focused work during the times you’ve set aside for working and give your mind a chance to relax during the time you set for leisure.</p>\r\n            <h3>Some extra effort</h3>\r\n            <p>There’s things about working remotely that are not apparently obvious until you find yourself in that situation. One of them is the extra effort you need to put with otherwise trivial activities such as basic communication.</p>\r\n            <p>There’s already a physical distance between me and my colleagues. I need to be extra mindful of the way I exchange information, collaborate or even argue. Doing those things face-to-face allows all sides in the conversation to gain this additional insight through body language and tone of voice.</p>\r\n            <p>When you work from home the only thing you have is real-time text or facial expressions at best, if you’re doing a video conference (which we aim to do as much as possible). You need to be careful not to create an even further distance between you and your team mates through the way you communicate.</p>\r\n            <p>Another thing I had to be mindful about is distractions at home. In the office, it can be needy colleagues. At home, it’s all those side things I suddenly think about that I need to do.</p>\r\n            <p>That lamp you haven’t had the time to put on? Cleaning the basement? Fixing your bike? All good, just bare in mind you still have a job that needs to be done with priority. What I mentioned above about focused work is true here as well. You need to create a strict discipline, relying only on yourself.</p>\r\n            <p>In an office, there’s other people watching you, which makes you stare at the screen during office hours (how much people work still depends largely on themselves). At home you need to be the one to watch out for distractions.</p>\r\n            <p>To be fair, this won’t be an issue, if you love what you’re doing. Working on diverse projects, having supportive colleagues and learning new skills every week will make any distractions insignificant.</p>\r\n            <h3>To conclude</h3>\r\n            <p>The last month has been a rollercoaster. Starting a new job completely changes your habits and daily routine, even more so if it’s a shift from an office job to a remote one. It takes some time and effort to adjust and get better at it. Often times it can be a bit more complicated than doing a 9-to-5, but I believe the personal experience and freedom you get in return are well worth the effort.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='data'><Link to='/blog'>←Back</Link></h2>\r\n        </animated.div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexport default RemoteMonth;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring';\r\nimport '../blog.css';\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport bvg1 from '../../../img/bvg1.png';\r\nimport bvg2 from '../../../img/bvg2.jpeg';\r\nimport bvg3 from '../../../img/bvg3.jpeg';\r\n\r\nconst BVG = () => {\r\n    const fade = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}, delay: 400})\r\n    return (        \r\n        <animated.div style={fade} className='about post'>\r\n            <h1 className='header'>The Case of the Berlin Public Transport - user engagement, the right way</h1>\r\n            <p>Berlin has one of the most amazing public transportation systems in the world, I kid you not. Coming from a city with disastrous transportation options, my opinion might seem exaggerated. But having been in cities like Stockholm, Copenhagen and Singapore, I still think the BVG or Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (Berlin Transportation Services) remains unrivalled. I’m not just saying this because of the impeccable timing of every U-Bahn or the 24 hours transport on weekends or the way the institution handles line repairs by introducing temporary substitutions. One of the things that distinguishes the BVG is the brand identity they’ve built through the years and the unusual way they engage with their audience.</p>\r\n            <h3>Some general information first</h3>\r\n            <img className='postImg' src={bvg1} alt=\"Berlin map\" />\r\n            <p>Berlin is divided into 3 zones in terms of public transport — A, B and C. Zone A is basically Mitte, Charlottenburg, Gesundbrunnen, Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain and the better part of Neuköln. Pretty much where most of the good stuff happens. Zone B is that place you go to when someone tells you there’s a neurofunk party at an abandoned industrial building. And you generally go to Zone C when you have to catch an airplane from Schönefeld.</p>\r\n            <p>The tickets available are either AB, BC or ABC and they’re valid for every form of public transport you see out there. That includes Bus, Tram, U-Bahn (subway) and S-Bahn (train). You can get out from one vehicle and switch to any number of others in any given direction (return trips not included) within a 2-hour limit.</p>\r\n            <p>Getting a ticket is easier than posting an instagram story. You just fire up the BVG app and you buy that little rascal with exactly 3 clicks. Your phone knows which station you’re at so it’ll be marked on your ticket, which will then help the BVG inspectors determine whether you’re a law-abiding citizen or a Schwarzfahrer (direct translation: black rider?).</p>\r\n            <p>OK, so far I’ve covered how effectively the Berlin transport system is organised, but I guess that doesn’t really impress you so much. I mean, it’s Germany — anyone would expect a punctual, high-functioning public service. So why am I bothering to write about it?</p>\r\n            <h3>The BVG brand</h3>\r\n            <img className='postImg' src={bvg2} alt=\"Berlin subway\" />\r\n            <p>About 3 years ago, the BVG decided it needs to get on the social media train. (see what I did there?). They created their new Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts and adopted the slogan “Weil wir dich lieben” (“Because we love you”). Immediately after that, they probably felt as if they’d opened Pandora’s box. Like any public service in every country on this planet, they were (and still are) the subject of constant critique and discontent from the people using it.</p>\r\n            <p>Bad tempered bus drivers, late trams, broken seats, dirty train carts and so on and so on. After all, a city’s public transport is a places where people feel quite miserable by default. It’s the place that you go to right after you’ve woken up from your comfy bed, it’s filled with all those other people you don’t know and don’t necessarily smell good and it’s supposed to bring you to your work. Then, after you finish work and you feel super tired from the bullshit you had to deal with all day, you’re supposed to get on it again so it can bring you home.</p>\r\n            <p>Just by existing, it’s already quite a shitty place to spend your time. All it takes is one grumpy driver for a person to snap. This built up pressure got released as soon as people had the means to communicate with the BVG. And their new slogan got people even more fired up. “Because we love you”? It’s as if the BVG was mocking them.</p>\r\n            <p>The challenging task of running all social media accounts, was given to Peter Wittkamp and Finn Kirchner, both previously working as writers for various comedy shows. They’re mission was to make people believe in the BVG slogan. Their approach? Unconditional self-irony.</p>\r\n            <p>The Berlin public transport is being used by more than a billion people per year. When things go wrong, they go wrong for a massive number of folks. A lot of the subway carts, as well as subway stations are old and need renovation. Bus drivers and conductors are often grumpy and if you’ve ever been to Berlin you can imagine what the subway looks like on Sunday mornings. These are all issues that the BVG cannot immediately fix.</p>\r\n            <img className='postImg' src={bvg3} alt=\"Berlin subway\" />\r\n            <p>So instead of ignoring what people were complaining about, especially the things that were beyond the power of the administration, the voices of the BVG started making jokes about it. Their idea was to create a brand around the chaotic, smelly, trashy environment that is the public transport system. It’s the perfect reflection of what the actual city is about. Berlin can be dirty, messy and rough, but this is exactly what grew to be its charm. In a way, the BVG perfectly captures what Berlin is about —sure, it has its issues, but that’s what makes it so special.</p>\r\n            <p>The BVG public voice is humorous and somewhat unapologetic. Apart from the cheerful posters, the its social profiles are very much active and people who address the BVG often get a response fairly quickly, albeit a response that usually makes a joke out of them.</p>\r\n            <p>Still, there are limits to what the BVG jokes about. Serious complaints are beyond the line of light-hearted responses. But as far as force majeure circumstances go, such as 5 minute delays, bad weather or someone puking on your shoes at the subway station — the BVG will push the limit to socially acceptable humour. And people will appreciate it.</p>\r\n            <h3>We love you too, BVG</h3>\r\n            <p>Berlin is one of the most diverse cities in the world. It’s a city of 4 million people, all trying to go about their day (or night) and make a good living. It’s a messy place that combines excessive freedoms with the security of German laws. People here feel safe doing whatever rocks their boat, without the fear of anyone judging them (except maybe if you’re wearing a suit). It’s the perfect place for a sarcastic, “no-fucks-given” public transport to thrive in.</p>\r\n            <p>And this is exactly the attitude it took to make people shift from complaining about ticket prices and dirty trains to sharing anecdotes with others online and adopting the Berlin public transport as one of the city’s most popular memes.</p>\r\n            <p>The BVG managed to turn the mass feelings of disdain for petty issues into warm shrugs and sighs that say “that’s just our good old BVG”. And that is a feat in itself.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='data'><Link to='/blog'>←Back</Link></h2>\r\n        </animated.div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\nexport default BVG;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring';\r\nimport '../blog.css';\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport berlin1 from '../../../img/berlin1.jpeg';\r\n\r\nconst MovingBerlin = () => {\r\n    const fade = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}, delay: 400})\r\n    return (        \r\n        <animated.div style={fade} className='about post'>\r\n            <h1 className='header'>Moving to Berlin in 10 simple steps</h1>\r\n            <img className='postImg' src={berlin1} alt=\"Berlin\" />\r\n            <p>I recently moved to Berlin.

You got the job already! You agreed on starting in a month, because of your current notice period. A month is an eternity. Make an appointment with the Bürgeramt, though. You need to register yourself shortly after you arrive in the city. You don’t want to mess with the Bürgeramt.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Talk to friends, spread the info</span> — Make sure to let everyone know you’re moving to Berlin. That way, when things fall apart, you’ll have the opportunity to explain yourself in front of everyone about what went wrong. You’ll also gain the benefit of receiving thousands of eyerolls for the rest of your life every time you share another plan with your friends.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Casually start browsing for apartments</span> — Maybe it’s time to start looking at places to live. You’ve heard from others that it takes time, so you want to have at least 1–2 weeks of applying for apartments. This should be enough.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Start applying for a room in a shared flat</span> — OK, looking for an apartment just for yourself is beyond your capabilities, both financially and administratively. You have to settle for living with flatmates. That’s more fun anyway. Plus, you’ve done it before when you were a student, remember? It was fun back then. Apply for 1 or 2 offers on WG-Gesucht and put all your hopes in either of those alternatives. Start planning your daily routes around your future apartment.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Realize the gravity of the situation</span> — After the 20th application you still haven’t received any replies (except for that scammer who wanted to send you the keys via DHL). Time is drawing near and by the looks of it you don’t seem to have anywhere to live when you arrive in Berlin. There’s always Airbnb, but that would surely be way more expensive. Panic mildly.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Go on a application frenzy</span> — Spend most of your remaining free time applying for whatever offer pops up on WG-Gesucht. Don’t even read the descriptions. It doesn’t matter where it’s located, who lives there or how many cats are living in the apartment. You need a roof, fast.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Find a temporary solution</span> — Receive news from a friend, who has a friend, who lives in Berlin. He lives in a huge flat together with his mates and has a big couch that you can sleep on until you find a better alternative. The 4am nervous contemplations reduce to just casual nail biting during the day.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Find the next temporary solution</span> — Finally someone replies to your application for a room. The original owner of the room is away for two weeks and that’s the only time the room would be available, but you’re still happy because things are moving forward. You have a plan now. Stay with your friend’s friend first, then go to this temporary room for two weeks, then figure it out.</p>\r\n            <p><span className='bold'>Arrive in Berlin</span> — Become totally overwhelmed by the sheer size, diversity and organisation of the city. Marvel about all the incredible places you can go, all the events you can attend and all the people you can meet. Explore the endless possibilities of the city and bare in mind that the struggle is far from over.</p>\r\n            <p>And there you have it — 10 easy steps to settling down in Berlin.
